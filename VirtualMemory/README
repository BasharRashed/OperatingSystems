REMARKS:
This virtual memory implementation employs a multi-level page table hierarchy to translate virtual
addresses to physical ones on demand. When a page fault occurs, a physical frame is allocated using
a specific strategy: prioritizing the next available unused frame, then reusing an empty intermediate
page table frame, and finally, if necessary, evicting an existing page. The eviction policy is based on
a custom "cyclic distance" algorithm, selecting the leaf page farthest from the current targetPage in a
conceptual ring. A key technique used to maintain integrity is the forbid array, which prevents any page
table frame actively involved in the current address translation path from being selected for eviction or
reuse. The system interfaces with an abstracted physical memory layer via PMread, PMwrite, PMevict, and
PMrestore functions.
